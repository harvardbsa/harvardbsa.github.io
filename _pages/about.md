The Harvard Bangladeshi Students Association (HBSA) is dedicated to fostering a vibrant, supportive, and empowered community for Bangladeshi students across all Harvard schools and programs. As an officially recognized university-wide student group, it aims to give a centralized platform for professional networking, cultural programming, and peer support, while celebrating the rich heritage of Bengali culture through diverse events. Beyond community-building, HBSA is committed to improving access to educational and professional opportunities for students of Bangladeshi origin and strengthen connections among Bangladeshi students, alumni, and affiliates at Harvard.
